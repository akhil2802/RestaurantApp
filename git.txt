git add .
git commit -m "inital commit"
git log
git log --oneline

first commit id: 77gh89
second: 98u6y8
third: 900cfcf

- Assume we're in third commit but we want the previous version(second):
git checkout 98u6y8
git commit -m "getting back to previous commit. this is current version                                on which we want to work on"
- Now, second commit becomes current version with new commit.
- To reset the changes we made by getting from third to second commit and making second as current version we use reset:
git  reset  HEAD  index.html  --> the file is in unstaged area and shows modified if we see the status. so to discard the changes in working directory use:
git checkout  --  index.html
- Now, we have restored to the end third commit. now third becomes current version as before.

NOte:
-------
* git reset <file> : unstage a staged file, but leave working directory unchanged.
* git reset : reset the staging area to the last commit without disturbing the working directory.

Set the local Git repository to set its remote origin:
    At the prompt, type the following to set up your local repository to link to your online Git repository:
- git remote add origin <repository URL>

Pushing your commits to the online repository:
    At the prompt, type the following to push the commits to the online repository:
- git push -u origin master

Cloning an online repository:
    To clone an online repository to your computer, type the following at the prompt:
- git clone <repository URL>

Conclusions:
* In this exercise you have learnt to set up an online Git repository, synchronize your local repository with the remote repository, and clone an online repository.

Node.js and NPM:
------------------------
package.json file: affords you a lot of great things like:
- it serves as documentation for what packages your proect depends on.
- it allows you to specify the versions of a packge that your project can use using semantic versioning rules.
- Make your build reproducible, which means that its way easier to share with other develoeprs.

Initializing package.json file:
- npm init --> asks for details and provide all of them.

Installing a liteserver module:
- npm install lite-server  --save-dev
here, --save-dev specifies this liteserver is used for development dependency for our project. it will be mentioned in package.json file.
- If we are installing node module on which our proect directly dependent on then we install it by just saying "--save" option not --save-dev. 

Exclude some of the folder, files while commiting to online git repository:
- here, we can exclude node_module folder which is being submitted to online git because we can get all the modules of node_module installed for us just by saying npm install.. this installs all the nodemodules present inside package.json file. If we say git commit then this node_modules folder wont be commited to repo.
